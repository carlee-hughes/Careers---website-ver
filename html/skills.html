        <h1 id="skillsimg" class="pageheaders">✧<br>✧<br>✧<br>Essential Skills<br>✧<br>✧<br>✧</h1>

        <p>When entering any field of study, it is important to understand what skills are considered 
            essential in order to be successful within it. Here, we will list and explain some of the most 
            essential skills and work habits required in order to succeed in computer science, based on information from the site            
            <!--link website--> <a href="https://www.skillszone.ca/" target="blank_">Ontario Skills Passport</a>.</p>


        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Problem Solving</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    When coding, you will often encounter challenges and problems where the solution is not always obvious. 
                    Coding in general often involves a lot of troubleshooting, revising and editing in order to identify mistakes. 
                    Having problem solving skills and critical thinking abilities is an essential skill to succeeding in computer science. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Communication</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Working in computer science often requires collaborating with other programmers and developers. 
                        For example, if you chose to become a <a href="/html/careers.html#targetS">software engineer</a>, you would need to collaborate 
                        with other engineers to meet project targets, discuss client needs, etc. The same goes for a <a href="/html/careers.html#target">game developer</a> 
                        where you will likely interact with an even wider variety of people, in which case, 
                        communication becomes essential, as not all of them will have a background in computer science. 
                        Many will be designers, storyboarders, artists and more. Good communication is an essential skill in the 
                        field of computer science. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Adaptability</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The field of computer science is an ever changing one. Unlike studies of the natural world, mostly related to discovery, 
                        computer science is an ever evolving field due to its inventive and human-made nature. New discoveries and inventions 
                        are constantly being made, and computer scientists must learn to quickly adapt to the progressive world they will be entering 
                        and working in. Therefore, adaptability is an essential skill required to be successful in the world of computer science. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Work Habits</h2>
        <p>Some useful work habits to consider are...</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Initiative</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Initiative is a great work habit to strengthen regardless of your industry, but it is especially important in computer science, 
                        as it demonstrates your efficiency and willingness to work hard in order to achieve your goals. It is an excellent work habit to 
                        build, and can improve your leadership skills. Either leading by example, or actually taking charge, by showing initiative, you 
                        will be recognized by potential employers for your dedication to the craft. Furthermore, initiative leads you to work efficiently, 
                        and work hard, self-regulate, and take responsibility. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Organization</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Coding is often a relatively chaotic process, but keeping your code organized is an essential work habit to build. 
                        Organization will help you succeed in the field, as it will make it easier for other programmers to work with you, as your 
                        code will be clean, organized and easy to comprehend. Furthermore, keeping your workspace organized is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usemotion.com/blog/benefits-of-being-organized#:~:text=When%20you're%20organized%2C%20you,more%20and%20stay%20on%20track.">proven</a> to improve work 
                        quality and efficiency. Being organized is beneficial for yourself and for others. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
