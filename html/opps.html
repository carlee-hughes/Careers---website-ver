        <center class="pageindex">
            <p>
                Sometimes it is difficult to decide where to get started. Fortunately, there are countless learning and 
                experiential opportunities offered in the field of computer science. These events, internships and apprentice-like 
                placements are great places to start if you're looking at how to get involved in the field. Here, we've 
                gathered three opportunities with a wide range of benefits to help you get started. 
                Click on any of the following links to take you to that part of the page.
            </p>
                    <a href="/html/opps.html#target1">Co-Op</a><br>

        <!--Co-Op-->
        <br id="target1">
        <h1>Co-Op Placement</h1>
        <h2>Co-Op Placement with the University of Ottawa</h2>

        <p> 
            Co-Op is a partnership between companies and students, where students take on work similar to that of an 
            apprentice, in exchange for work experience and learning opportunities. An example of somewhere you could 
            participate in a Co-Op program is the university of Ottawa (link), where you will be placed to work in 
            workplaces, and gain credits and experience for the university, organized by it. 
        </p>

        <h2>How to apply</h2>
        
        <p>According to the University of Ottawa's </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can apply to co-op jobs posted exclusively for University of Ottawa co-op students, via the 
                CO-OP Navigator or the co-op app. You must participate in the "placement process" to apply to these jobs. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply to other potential jobs on external websites through the IndEx tool. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You can apply to jobs on the CO-OP Navigator / Co-op app
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            However, for more information about the application process, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uottawa.ca/current-students/career-experiential-learning/coop">here</a>.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            Co-Op will allow you to gain real work experience, while still learning on the job and being taught. 
            Although it is unlikely you will get paid, you will gain experience, credentials, and knowledge that will contribute 
            to your credibility and desirability to have in a workplace. Co-Op is also a good, low-risk way to discover whether 
            or not a field of study is really for you. Something may sound good on paper, but not in practice. Co-Op will also 
            allow you to build relationships  with the company or organization you do your Co-Op at, which may help you with 
            recommendations and finding work later on, or even being employed by them.

        <h1>Summer Internship</h1>
        <h2>Future Tech Summer Internship at Nokia</h2>

        <p> 
            You can take a summer internship at Nokia, in order to learn on-the-job and get real world work experience, 
            a step up from Co-Op. The program is eight weeks, where you work alongside engineering teams in order to solve 
            real problems for the company. The difference here is that while Co-Op typically goes through the school, 
            and is organized and related directly to gaining credits, the Nokia internship program is separate from academics. 
            However, you will learn extraordinary coding and computer science skills, and even get paid for your work. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                You must be registered in two of the following grade 12 courses: Physics, Chemistry, Advanced Functions, 
                Calculus and Vectors, Computer Science, Biology, Earth and Space Science, Computer Engineering Technology, 
                and Manufacturing Engineering Technology.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have to make a video to apply, demonstrating a computer science related project you have made.

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            You will learn from Nokia Future Tech Mentors while working on solving genuine technical and computer science 
            related problems. It is an excellent opportunity to learn hands-on and on the job what it is like to properly 
            work in the computer science industry. By doing the internship, you will gain valuable knowledge and skills, and 
            build your work habits. It provides you with an opportunity to make connections with people working in the tech 
            industry, and meet others close in age interested in the same topics. It is financially beneficial on top of all 
            of this, as you will be paid a typical hourly (minimum) wage.
