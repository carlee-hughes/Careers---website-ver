        Some of the most prevalent trends affecting computer science are AI, cloud computing and blockchain. AI advancements - while speeding up the programming process and increasing efficiency 
        - also pose threats to the demand for computer scientists. The job market may shrink, as companies rely more heavily on artificial intelligence, needing less human monitoring resources. 
        Those pursuing degrees in the fields of computer science will have to navigate their future job prospects. <br><br>Cloud computing is also greatly influencing the computer science job market, and 
        the future of the field. Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, speeding up communication, efficiency and service. It makes collaborating on code easier, 
        but also increases the complexity of future jobs, due to the many factors that now need to be considered on a global scale. <br><br>Blockchains are also influencing computer science as a field. A blockchain 
        is defined as a “digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network”. Blockchain technology in computer science offers decentralized and secure frameworks for 
        applications, improves security and efficiency, and is likely to lead more people to invest in computer science due to its growing opportunities.
